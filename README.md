# Drapefit
DrapeFit is a web-based virtual try-on system designed to enhance the online clothing shopping experience. The project enables users to create a personalized 3D avatar through quiz-based inputs, ensuring the avatar reflects the user’s body type and preferences. After registration or login, users can complete a FitQuiz to provide details such as size, body shape, chest, and fit preference. The system then generates a corresponding 3D avatar in real time. Users also have the option to upload a face image, which is mapped onto the avatar using face-mesh techniques, creating a more realistic and personalized experience. The platform allows shirt textures to be dynamically applied to the avatar, giving a true-to-life visualization of how the clothing might look when worn. With interactive controls, users can rotate, zoom, and inspect the avatar from different angles, offering a 360° virtual try-on capability. Built with React on the frontend, Three.js for 3D rendering, and Node.js for backend services, the system provides seamless integration of UI and 3D graphics. Image uploads are validated and processed securely, ensuring only supported file types are used. The platform focuses on reducing product return rates by helping users make more confident purchase decisions. By combining questionnaires, avatar customization, and texture mapping, DrapeFit bridges the gap between digital browsing and physical try-on. It supports scalability and modular design through component-based architecture. The use of object-oriented principles allows each module, such as FitQuiz, ModelViewer, and Upload, to work independently yet cohesively. Restful APIs are employed for communication between frontend and backend, ensuring fast and reliable data exchange. Face integration and UV mapping techniques enhance realism and immersion. The platform prioritizes user-friendliness with an intuitive interface and easy navigation. Security measures are implemented in the upload process to protect user data. Mobile compatibility ensures accessibility across devices. The project incorporates layered architecture with presentation, application, and data layers for better maintainability. It leverages algorithms for avatar sizing, face mapping, and texture application. Blender is used for UV unwrapping and preparing 3D models before integration. Users can interact not just with the clothing textures but also with avatar perspectives, making the experience more interactive. Questionnaire results directly influence model generation, adding personalization. The modular design allows future enhancements like AI-driven recommendations or body measurement prediction. By simulating a physical fitting room virtually, DrapeFit significantly improves customer satisfaction. The system represents a step forward in AR and 3D-based e-commerce innovation. Its goal is to provide customers with confidence in online shopping and reduce uncertainty about fit and style. Overall, DrapeFit serves as a bridge between technology and fashion, combining usability, interactivity, and reliability into a single platform.
